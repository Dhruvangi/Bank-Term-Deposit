# Bank-Term-Deposit
- Problem- Statement:
The data is related with direct marketing campaigns at a banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.


- Goal:
The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit (variable y).

- Data set has a 10 categorical variable and 10 Numerical Variable varibable

     Categorical:
     job, marital, education, default, housing , contact, month, poutcome, loan, day_of_week
     
     Numerical: 
     age, pdays, day, duration, campaign, previous, emp.var.rate, cons.conf.idx, euribor3m, employed
  # Did your profile Subscribe versus unsubscribe very well?    
- most of the people age between 30 to 50 but students and retired are more likely to subscribe.
- Job attribute: we can see the count of 'admin is higher than the other. Also, the count for 'blue-collar' is noticeable, and blue-collar and white-collar(manager,admin) job type   people are more likely to subscribe.    
- A high proportion of non-defaulters corresponds to the total of term deposit takers. It seems that it makes good sense that people with credit do not want to subscribe to a new   bank offer.
- More people with higher education degrees were subscribed. Proportional relationship. More secondary profiles mean more term deposits were sold.
- Count of married and single clients were more and they were showing more interest in bank term deposits than divorced.
- The clients who don't have taken any personal loans have subscribed to a term deposit with more than 50% chances.
- Customers who previously accepted the deposit tends to accept the deposit.
- As days Distribution histogram skewed to the right, Most of the clients were not previously contacted those are considered to be new clients.
- The success of the previous marketing campaign is not noticeable as we can see in the graph. Poutcome doest not exist for most of the customers and previously have not been       contacted 
- All the Categories in each categorical variable have out of proportion 'yes' compared to 'no' for term deposits subscription.
  Previous campaign calls failed to get customers to subscribe to bank term deposits.
- In- months of March, September, October, and December, the client show high interest in depositing. In the month of may, records are high but the client interest ratio is very     less
